These utilities come from the NIST Network Graph Toolkit ( https://math.nist.gov/~RPozo/ngraph/ngraph_toolkit_index.html )

We just need two:
 adj2g - converts an 'adjacency' format to a graph format
 g2mtx - converts a graph format to an mtx format (used by ColPack)

Note that g2mtx has some slight modifications since nigraph.cc doesn't exist ( is replaced by ngraph.h )
